# Genetic Correlation and scDRS Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains code and instructions for performing genetic correlation analysis using LDSC and cell-type-specific enrichment analysis using scDRS.

## Overview

- **LDSC (Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression)** is used to compute genetic correlations between neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders using GWAS summary statistics.
- **scDRS (single-cell Disease Relevance Score)** is used to assess cell-type enrichment of disease-associated gene sets in single-cell transcriptomic data.
